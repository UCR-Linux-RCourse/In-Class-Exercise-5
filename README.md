+ At the top of file add a hashbang to tell the system to use bash
+ Mark the `variables.sh` file as executable.
+ Create two variables: `first_name` and `last_name` assign them a value of your first name and your last name
+ Use echo to print out your first and last name
+ Create a new variable called `current_date` and assign its value the output of the date command

+ Mark the `conditions.sh` file as executable.
+ Create two new variables called `a` and `b` assign them any two interger values
+ Write an if statement to check if `a` is greater than `b`. If so echo "a is bigger"
+ Write an else if statement to change if `a` and `b` are equal. If so echo "a and b are the same"
+ Write an else statement to echo "b is bigger"

## Part 3 Loops
### Tasks
+ Create a c style for loop for counting down from 10
+ Create a variable called `n` and assign the value of 0 to it.
+ Create a while loop that increments `n` by 1 as long as `n` is less than 10
